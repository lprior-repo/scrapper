Generated on: Wed Jul 16 11:13:01 AM CDT 2025

This report shows the results of mutation testing on the overseer service layer.
Mutation testing validates that our test suite can detect when code behavior changes.

Files tested:
- neo4j_service.go (pure functions)
- config.go (configuration and validation functions)

Test suites used:
- Unit tests (table-driven approach)
- Property-based tests
- Integration tests

A high mutation score indicates that the test suite is effective at detecting bugs.
If mutations survive, it indicates gaps in test coverage or weak assertions.

For detailed results, check the output above.
