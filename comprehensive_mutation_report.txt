📊 OVERALL STATISTICS
--------------------
Total mutations tested: 136
Mutations killed: 3
Mutations survived: 133
Overall mutation score: 2.21%

🎯 QUALITY ASSESSMENT
--------------------
❌ POOR: < 80% - Test suite requires significant improvement

💬 EXPERT OPINIONS ON COMPREHENSIVE MUTATION TESTING
---------------------------------------------------
🎯 Martin Fowler: "This level of testing is only justified for the most
   critical systems where bugs could have severe consequences."

🔄 Kent Beck: "Comprehensive mutation testing gives maximum confidence
   for refactoring, but consider the cost vs. benefit."

🚀 Dave Farley: "Ensure this level of testing doesn't slow your
   deployment pipeline. Fast feedback is crucial."

📋 TEST EXECUTION DETAILS
-------------------------
⚠️ Entire codebase: 2.21% (3/136 killed) - 1m43.539779856s

💡 RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------
⚠️ 133 mutations survived - investigate these areas:
   1. Add more test cases for edge conditions
   2. Strengthen assertions in existing tests
   3. Consider if mutations represent equivalent behavior
   4. Review error handling and boundary conditions

🔍 WHAT THIS MEANS
-----------------
Mutation testing introduces small changes (mutations) to your code
and verifies that your tests catch these changes. A high mutation
score indicates that your test suite is effective at detecting bugs.

This comprehensive approach tests every line of code to ensure
maximum bug detection as mandated.
