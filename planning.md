# GitHub Codeowners Visualization Project Planning

## Project Overview and Goals

### Vision

Create a comprehensive GitHub organization scanner and codeowners visualization tool that provides deep insights into code ownership patterns, team structures, and repository relationships through an intuitive graph interface.

### Primary Goals

1. **Automated Organization Analysis**: Scan GitHub organizations to extract comprehensive data about repositories, teams, users, and ownership patterns
2. **CODEOWNERS Intelligence**: Parse and analyze CODEOWNERS files to understand code ownership distribution and coverage
3. **Interactive Visualization**: Provide an intuitive graph-based interface for exploring relationships between entities
4. **Actionable Insights**: Generate statistics and reports to help organizations improve their code ownership practices
5. **Enterprise-Ready**: Build a scalable, secure, and performant solution suitable for large organizations

### Target Users

- Engineering managers seeking visibility into code ownership
- DevOps teams managing repository permissions
- Security teams auditing access controls
- Individual contributors understanding team structures

## Architecture Decisions

### Backend: Go Language

**Rationale:**

- Excellent concurrency support for parallel GitHub API calls
- Strong typing for reliable data processing
- Native compilation for optimal performance
- Minimal memory footprint
- Built-in testing framework

**Architecture Pattern: Pure Core/Impure Shell**

- **Pure Core**: Business logic, data transformations, and algorithms
- **Impure Shell**: I/O operations, API calls, database interactions
- Benefits: Enhanced testability, clear separation of concerns, easier maintenance

### Frontend: React with TypeScript

**Rationale:**

- Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Large ecosystem of visualization libraries
- Strong community support

**Key Libraries:**

- **Effect-TS**: Functional programming patterns for robust error handling
- **cytoscape**: Graph visualization with interactive capabilities
- **Bun**: Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager

### Database: Neo4j

**Rationale:**

- Native graph database optimized for relationship queries
- Cypher query language ideal for traversing ownership hierarchies
- Built-in visualization tools for debugging
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- ACID compliance for data integrity

### Infrastructure

- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployments
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container orchestration
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Architecture

1. **Resource-Oriented**: URLs represent resources (organizations, repositories, teams)
2. **HTTP Methods**: Proper use of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
3. **Status Codes**: Meaningful HTTP status codes for all responses
4. **Versioning**: API versioning through URL path (/api/v1/)

### Endpoint Structure

```
/api/v1/
├── organizations/
│   ├── {org}/
│   ├── {org}/scan
│   └── {org}/stats
├── repositories/
│   └── {org}/{repo}/
├── graph/
│   └── {org}/
├── health/
├── version/
└── docs/
```

### Response Format

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2025-07-19T00:00:00Z",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

### Error Handling

- Consistent error structure
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Error codes for programmatic handling
- Rate limit information in headers

## Frontend Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

```
App
├── Layout
│   ├── Header
│   ├── Sidebar
│   └── MainContent
├── GraphView
│   ├── GraphCanvas
│   ├── GraphControls
│   └── GraphLegend
├── StatsView
│   ├── OverviewCards
│   ├── Charts
│   └── Tables
└── Settings
    ├── APIConfig
    └── DisplayPreferences
```

### State Management with Effect-TS

1. **Service Layer**: Encapsulate API calls and business logic
2. **Effect Patterns**: Use Effect for async operations and error handling
3. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for compile-time guarantees
4. **Functional Approach**: Immutable data structures and pure functions

### Graph Visualization with vis-network

1. **Dynamic Rendering**: Render large graphs efficiently
2. **Interactive Features**: Pan, zoom, node selection
